## Pilot Selection Framework

Use this framework during the workshop (Segment 5) to select the initial pilot:

| Criterion | Weight | Candidate 1 | Candidate 2 | Candidate 3 |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Regulatory urgency** — does solving this reduce audit risk now? | High | | | |
| **Data readiness** — is the FHIR/clinical data loaded and accessible? | High | | | |
| **Team availability** — can Privacy + Engineering staff this? | Medium | | | |
| **Architecture coverage** — does it exercise governance, detection, and scoring? | Medium | | | |
| **Research potential** — does it enable downstream research use cases? | Low | | | |

**Likely pilot candidates** (based on discovery):
1. **PHI Classification Sweep** — Run automated detection against existing CURATED tables, remediate top-10 gaps
2. **Patient Matching for Population Health** — FHIR + Claims entity resolution for cohort identification
3. **Research Dataset Provenance** — Track de-identification lineage for existing ML training datasets
