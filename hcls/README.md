# Healthcare & Life Sciences — Staffing, Outcomes & Payer Intelligence Platform

> **Three-System HCLS Analytics on Snowflake** — Epic/FHIR clinical data, Workday HCM workforce data, and payer adjudication data unified through an Ontology Knowledge Graph to reveal cross-system correlations between staffing decisions, patient outcomes, and payer behavior.

## Executive Summary

This demo extends the core DCA (Data Cloud Architecture) platform into a full three-system HCLS analytics platform. It proves three core analytical theses:

1. **Understaffing correlates with worse patient outcomes** — Nurse-patient ratios, overtime, and staffing adequacy predict readmissions, adverse events, and length-of-stay outliers.
2. **Comorbidity burden drives payer behavior patterns** — Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) stratification reveals systematic denial rate escalation, adjudication delays, and care gap patterns by risk tier.
3. **The Knowledge Graph reveals cross-system insights invisible in flat data** — Ontological edges connecting clinical, workforce, and financial entities surface correlations that no single-system query can produce.

### Source Systems

| `plans` | 50 | plan_id, type (Medicare Advantage, PPO, HMO, Medicaid, HDHP) |
| `members` | 10,000 | member_id, patient_id, plan_id |

| `quality_measures` | 5,000 | measure_id, HEDIS code, compliance rate |

## Cross-System Ontology

All three data generators use deterministic `uuid5` seeds for entity linkage:

| Linkage Key | Pattern | Connects |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `patient_id` | `uuid5(NAMESPACE_OID, f'patient_{seed}_{i}')` | FHIR patients ↔ Payer members |
| `org_id` | `uuid5(NAMESPACE_OID, f'org_{seed}_{i}')` | FHIR organizations ↔ Workday departments |
| `NPI` | Generated for physicians/NPs/PAs | FHIR practitioners ↔ Workday workers |
| `encounter_id` | `uuid5(NAMESPACE_OID, f'encounter_{seed}_{i}')` | FHIR encounters ↔ Payer claims/reviews |

The Knowledge Graph uses these linkage keys to create `SAME_AS` edges for cross-system entity resolution.

## Knowledge Graph — HCLS Extensions

The base Knowledge Graph (core scripts 11-15) provides foundational nodes and edges. The HCLS demo extends it across three domains:

### Clinical (Scripts 01-03)
- **Node types**: ENCOUNTER, CONDITION, MEDICATION, PROCEDURE, PRACTITIONER, CLAIM, ORGANIZATION
- **Edge types**: DIAGNOSED_WITH, PRESCRIBED, PERFORMED_BY, RESULTED_IN, BILLED_FOR, REFERRED_TO, TREATED_AT
- **PHI governance**: PHI_CONTAINS, HIPAA_CLASSIFIED, BAA_COVERS, DE_IDENTIFIED_FROM
- **RAI inference**: Care pathways, entity resolution, HIPAA compliance scoring

### Workforce (Scripts 04-05)
- **Node types**: WORKER (`WD_WKR_`), DEPARTMENT (`WD_DEPT_`), STAFFING_CONTEXT (`WD_STAFF_`)
- **Edge types**: ASSIGNED_TO (`WD_ASGN_`), EMPLOYED_AT (`WD_EMP_`), SAME_AS (`WD_MATCH_`), INFLUENCED_BY (`WD_INF_`), UNDERSTAFFED_DURING (`WD_UNDER_`)
- **Analytics tables**: HCLS_STAFFING_CONTEXT, HCLS_STAFFING_OUTCOME_METRICS, HCLS_CORRELATION_RESULTS

### Comorbidity & Payer (Script 06)
- **Node types**: CCI_TIER (`PYR_CCI_`), PLAN (`PYR_PLAN_`), DENIAL_PATTERN (`PYR_DENY_`)
- **Edge types**: RISK_STRATIFIED (`PYR_RISK_`), COVERED_BY (`PYR_COV_`), DENIED_FOR (`PYR_DENYEDGE_`), COMORBID_WITH (`PYR_COMRB_`)
- **Analytics tables**: HCLS_PATIENT_COMORBIDITY, HCLS_COMORBIDITY_PAIRS, HCLS_PAYER_METRICS, HCLS_CARE_GAPS

## Key Analytical Questions

### Staffing & Outcomes
- Does understaffing correlate with readmissions in our ICU?
- What is the relationship between overtime and adverse events?
- Which units have the highest turnover AND worst outcomes?
- Are there seasonal staffing patterns that predict outcome variance?

### Comorbidity & Risk
- What are the most common comorbidity clusters in our population?
- How does CCI score affect length of stay and total cost?
- Which comorbidity pairs co-occur most frequently?
- What is the cost differential between LOW and SEVERE CCI tiers?

### Payer Intelligence
- Which payers deny most frequently for high-comorbidity patients?
- What is the gap between payer-approved and actual LOS by risk tier?
- Where are prior auth delays causing care delivery bottlenecks?
- What are denial rates by plan type (Medicare Advantage, PPO, HMO, Medicaid, HDHP)?

### Governance
- Can we prove every PHI column is classified and masked?
- Are ML training datasets derived from PHI under approved protocols?
- What is the HIPAA compliance score per dataset?
- Which datasets have orphaned ownership?
